package main

/*Write a Go program that takes a slice of integers as input and returns a new slice containing only the unique elements from the original slice, in the order they appeared.

Use the fmt package to prompt the user to enter a series of integers, separated by spaces.

Ex:
Input: 3 5 2 5 7 3 8
Unique elements: [3 5 2 7 8]

You can solve it using a map or only using slices.
