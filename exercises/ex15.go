package main

/*Write a Go program that reads a file and counts the number of lines, handling file reading errors.


Example:
Input: input.txt
Number of lines in the file: 10

Input: non_existent.txt
Error: open non_existent.txt: no such file or directory

If the file is not there or any error happens this should be handled.

Tips: Implement the countLines function to handle file opening, line counting, and error handling using os.Open and bufio.Scanner.
