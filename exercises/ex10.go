package main

/*
Write a Go program that takes a series of numbers separated by spaces as input and calculates the average of those numbers using slices.

Ex:
Input: 10 20 30 40 50
Output: 30

Tip: To read a series of space-separated numbers, you can use the fmt.Scanln function and then use the strings.Fields function to split the input into individual numbers.
